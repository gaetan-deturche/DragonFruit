//! Organic cut — split a mesh into two parts along a user-drawn surface loop.
//!
//! The user draws a closed loop on the model surface; from it we build a cutter
//! and boolean-split the model into two printable parts (`part_a` / `part_b`).
//!
//! MILESTONE M2 (current): **trivial planar cut**. We derive a single cutting
//! plane from the loop (centroid + averaged normal) and split the model with
//! `manifold-csg`'s `split_by_plane`. This is not yet the contour-following
//! "wafer" (that is M4) — it is the simplest cut that actually divides the mesh,
//! so the full draw → split → two-parts → render pipeline runs end to end on the
//! production boolean engine. The wafer replaces the plane later without changing
//! this module's signature.
//!
//! If the `manifold` feature is off, or the loop is degenerate, or manifold
//! rejects the mesh, we fall back to the M1 no-op (both parts = source) so the
//! round-trip never hard-fails.
