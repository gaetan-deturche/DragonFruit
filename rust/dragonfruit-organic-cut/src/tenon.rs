//! Registration tenon — a tenon + matching mortise straddling an organic cut, so the
//! two severed halves mortise together in exactly one alignment.
//!
//! The geometric idea (see `.scratch/organic-cut-tenon-dev-plan.md`):
//!   1. Derive a **frame** from the membrane: anchor = its centroid, axis = its
//!      average normal (the same +normal direction the part-grouping uses), and
//!      `cut_area` = the membrane surface area.
//!   2. Build a **tapered rectangular frustum** (wide base on the cut, narrow tip)
//!      sized from `cut_area`. The **tenon** (nominal) is union'd onto `part_a`
//!      (the +normal side); the **mortise** (tenon dilated by the fit tolerance) is
//!      differenced from `part_b`.
//!   3. Enforce **≥1 mm of solid material between tenon and wall on both halves**:
//!      shrink the frustum to fit; if it can't fit, fall back to a **half-sphere
//!      dome**; if even that can't fit, place **no tenon**. Each rung records WHY.
//!
//! Everything tenon-related lives in THIS module — nothing leaks into mesh-repair.
//! Requires the `manifold` feature (the boolean backend); gated at the crate root.
