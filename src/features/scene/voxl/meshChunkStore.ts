/**
 * COW compressed-chunk store (Ph0.1 sub-phase C).
 *
 * ## The defect this replaces
 *
 * The VOXL writer memoised each model's **raw** binary STL bytes keyed on a
 * geometry signature, then threw the compressed result away. Every 30 s autosave
 * tick therefore re-ran zlib-6 over every model's entire geometry — measured at
 * **3 589 ms / 172 MiB for one 4M-tri model** and **11 125 ms / 515 MiB for a
 * 3-model plate** — even when nothing but a camera transform had changed. The
 * memo also had exactly one `.get` and one `.set` and no eviction anywhere, so a
 * deleted 4M-tri model kept ~191 MiB of raw STL resident for the rest of the
 * session.
 *
 * ## The two properties that carry the design
 *
 * **1. Dirty tracking is by geometry SIGNATURE, not by a boolean flag.**
 * `ExportManager.computeModelGeometrySignature` is promoted from a private cache
 * key to the dirty primitive. It is derived from the geometry object itself
 * (`uuid : position.version : index.version : vertexCount`), so it cannot drift
 * the way a flag missed by a future mutation path would. The consequence worth
 * stating: because the signature is the authority and the bake hooks are merely
 * *when*, a missed hook costs a lazy re-bake on the next tick — **never a stale
 * write**. That makes the hook placement an optimization, not a correctness
 * dependency.
 *
 * **2. The store is content-addressed, two levels deep.**
 *
 * ```
 *   owner (modelId + slot)  →  { signature, sha256 }
 *   sha256                  →  { data, compression, uncompressedSize, refs }
 * ```
 *
 * One mechanism buys three things: cross-tick reuse (level 1 hit), memory-side
 * dedup across instances of the same geometry (level 2 collision), and
 * refcounted eviction (level 2 `refs` reaching zero).
 *
 * ## Ph5 forward-compat (design only — not implemented here)
 *
 * The coming VOXL original-mesh embed must be written **through** this store.
 * That is why owners are keyed on `(modelId, slot)` rather than `modelId`: Ph5
 * bakes the original once at import with `slot: 'original'`, every subsequent
 * tick and explicit save references the same blob, a second import of the same
 * file collides on SHA and costs nothing, and `release(modelId)` still frees
 * both slots in one call from `deleteModels`.
