/**
 * useOrganicCutSession — owns ALL Cutting Mode state and the cut round-trip.
 *
 * This hook exists so the giant app shell (src/app/page.tsx) only needs three
 * additive lines: an import, a hook call, and the two JSX mounts (the in-canvas
 * <OrganicCutTool> and the out-of-canvas <OrganicCutPanel>). Every piece of
 * organic-cut logic lives here inside the feature directory, keeping the feature
 * self-contained and the seam into page.tsx as small as possible.
 *
 * MULTI-LOOP: a cut can carry several loops at once (contour mode). They live in
 * one ordered `loops` list with one ACTIVE loop (`activeLoopIndex`); the active
 * loop gets the full waypoint-editing UI, the others render as dimmed seams. The
 * user switches the active loop freely (panel chips) to go back and adjust any of
 * them. On Apply, every loop's cutter is union'd and differenced in one shot — the
 * way to free a part attached in several places (e.g. a tail joined at two posts).
