/**
 * Where the last refused cut went wrong, pinned in the viewport.
 *
 * The cut refuses with a reason and a set of places, and a place is only useful if
 * the user can go and look at it. These are those places. They replace a ball of
 * translucent colour per spot, which was findable and useless in the same breath:
 * big enough to see meant big enough to hide the geometry the user had to inspect.
 *
 * So the pin is drawn as a map pin is drawn, and for the same reason — a map pin
 * has to point at one building without covering the street:
 *
 * - The TIP is the spot, exactly, marked with a small ring and a cross. Nothing is
 *   drawn over the spot itself.
 * - The STEM leans away and up, so everything the pin has to say about itself is
 *   said in empty space above the geometry, not on top of it.
 * - The HEAD is an outline, not a disc, and carries the pin's NUMBER — the same
 *   number the message beside the Cut button counts up to, so "three places" and
 *   the three things on screen are the same three things.
 *
 * Constant size on screen, because a spot that has to be found must not shrink into
 * the model as the user zooms out to look for it; and drawn through the model
 * (`depthTest: false`), because the spot is as often on the far side as the near
 * one. Both of those are what make it findable — the size and opacity of the ink
 * are then free to stay out of the way, which is the whole trade the ball got wrong.
 *
 * Not a colour preference. This is a status, like a form error, and a preference is
 * a way to make it invisible — the same reasoning as `TENON_WONT_FIT_COLORS`.
