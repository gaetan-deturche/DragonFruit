/**
 * The live lean/roll of the registration tenon, as a matrix.
 *
 * The tenon SOUP is built STRAIGHT in Rust and the aim is applied here, so dragging
 * the gizmo never costs a Rust round-trip. The price is that this has to match
 * `LeanXform` in `tenon.rs` exactly — every sign in it has a twin over there — which
 * is why it lives in its own module with its own tests instead of inside a
 * component: the mismatches are invisible on screen until they are gross, and the
 * only ones we ever shipped were sign errors.
 *
 * CRITICAL: the soup is built in the Rust BUILD frame
 * (`frame_extruding_toward_part_b`) — the reported natural frame with the axis
 * NEGATED and u/v SWAPPED. Leaning in the natural frame instead would MIRROR the
 * result, because that swap flips handedness.
 *
 * Returns null when there is nothing to apply (no lean, no roll).
