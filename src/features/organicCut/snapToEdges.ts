 *
 * When the user places cut waypoints "in a crease" but a little off it, this
 * pulls each point onto the nearest sharp edge so the cut follows the fold
 * exactly. Where multiple feature edges meet in one spot (a box corner, a
 * crease junction), that corner is a stronger target than a lone edge — a point
 * near it is snapped to the corner itself rather than sliding onto one edge.
 *
 * It's a pure geometry helper: give it the loop points and the model geometry
 * (both in the SAME model-local space — they are, since waypoints are stored in
 * the geometry's local space; see OrganicCutTool) and it returns the
 * repositioned points.
 *
 * Sharp edges are found with THREE.EdgesGeometry, which emits an edge wherever
 * the two faces sharing it differ in orientation by more than a threshold angle
 * (a crease), plus every boundary (single-face) edge. The same primitive is
 * already used in this feature for the tenon-preview silhouette.
