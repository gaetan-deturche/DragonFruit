/**
 * Protractor dial for the rotation rings — the pure model.
 *
 * The dial appears while a ring handle is held and stays FIXED at the angle the
 * handle was grabbed at: every angle here is measured from that grab, so the
 * gesture is purely relative. A model sitting at 47.3 degrees that is dragged to
 * the dial's +10 mark ends at 57.3, wherever the handle happened to be parked.
 *
 * Anatomy, from the centre outwards (PrusaSlicer's dial with the rim marks
 * turned inward, which is what the maintainer asked for):
 *
 *   0.0 R .. 0.3 R    no magnet
 *   0.3 R .. 0.6 R    45-degree spokes; the magnet holds these
 *   0.6 R .. 0.9 R    no magnet
 *   0.9 R .. 1.0 R    5- and 10-degree rim marks; the magnet holds these
 *   past 1.0 R        no magnet
 *
 * The 30/30/30/10 split of the radius is measured off a top-down view of the
 * reference dial, and R is the ring the axis already draws.
 *
 * "No magnet" is not "no pointer": in those coronas the moving radius follows the
 * pointer exactly as it does everywhere else, and the rotation is free. The
 * coronas without a magnet are the point, not an oversight — they are what lets
 * the pointer sit visually close to a mark and still rotate freely, which is the
 * behaviour the maintainer demonstrated from PrusaSlicer (pointer between the
 * spokes and the rim marks, right next to a spoke, unattracted).
